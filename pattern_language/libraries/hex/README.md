# hex

The `hex` library contains functions that are exposed by the ImHex Hex Editor.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This library depends on various ImHex features and is therefore only available in ImHex as a language extension. If you're using the Pattern Language outside of ImHex, this library will be unavailable.
