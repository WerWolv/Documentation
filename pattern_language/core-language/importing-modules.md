# Importing modules

Patterns can be split into multiple files to better separate pattern code into logical sections. To import other files into the current file, pattern language provides two facilities: the `#include` directive and the `import` statement. Both will search for a given file inside the `includes` folder in pattern search paths. The default search paths are:

* The `includes` folder inside the ImHex installation directory.
* The `AppData/Local/imhex/includes` directory.
* Additional search paths. To add additional search paths go to `Extras > Settings > Folders` menu.

### `#include` directive

A [preprocessor directive](preprocessor.md). The preprocessor replaces this directive with all the lexical tokens from the included file *including* all the preprocessor defines. On inclusion, this system maintains its own list of files marked with [`#pragma once`](#include-guards).

To use the `#include` directive, specify a path to the file to include followed by the file extension. The path can be enclosed in double quotes (`"path/filename.extension"`) or pointy braces (`<path/filename.extension>`). The extension is optional. The `#include` directive looks for a file with extensions `.pat` and `.hexpat` if none is specified. However, by convention, the extension is specified when including files. Both of the following are valid ways to use the `#include` directive:

```rust
#include "std/io.pat"
#include <std/string.pat>
```

### `import` statement

The `import` statement is processed during the parsing stage. Once the parser encounters this statement, a separate parser is created to parse the imported file as a separate compilation unit. It's then inserted into the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the current file. The preprocessor defines *don't propagate* when using the `import` statement.

The `import` keyword is followed by the path to the file to include with the dot (`.`) as the folder separator. The file extension will be resolved automatically. The statement looks for a file with extensions `.pat` and `.hexpat`. As with any other language statement, the line must end with a semicolon (`;`).

```rust
import sys.mem;
```

### Include guards

#### `#pragma once` directive

To prevent duplicate declarations, files meant for importing to other files can use the `#pragma once` directive to prevent multiple inclusions. **Important**, both `#include` directive and `import` statements keep their own list of files marked with `#pragma once`. That means when a file is included in the current file, and then transitively imported by importing a different file, the current file would get duplicate declarations. In other words, a file should only ever be included by using one of the systems: the `#include` directive or the `import` statement to prevent duplicate declarations.

#### Manual include guards

When using `#include`, you can write include guards manually using `#ifndef` and `#define` directives:

```C++
#ifndef FOO_HEXPAT
#define FOO_HEXPAT

// Pattern code

#endif
```

#### Importing standard library headers

The standard library headers all use the `import` statement internally, and as such should be imported using `import`.

```rust
import std.io;
import std.mem;
import type.float16;
```

*Note* however, that this only pertains to standard library headers. Custom patterns can still import standard library headers while using `#include` for files that are part of the client project.

### Forward declarations.

The pattern language supports [forward declarations](data-types.md#forward-declaration).
