# Attributes

Attributes are special directives that can add extra configuration to individual variables and types.

```rust
struct RGBA8 {
  u8 red   [[color("FF0000")]];
  u8 green [[color("00FF00")]];
  u8 blue  [[color("0000FF")]];
} [[static, color(std::format("{:02X}{:02X}{:02X}", red, green, blue))]];
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Attributes can either have no arguments: `[[attribute_name]]`Or one or more arguments: `[[attribute_name("arg1", 1234)]]`
{% endhint %}

It’s also possible to apply multiple attributes to the same variable or type: `[[attribute1, attribute2(1234)]]`

### Variable Attributes

{% hint style="info" %}
Variable attributes may also be applied to types directly to cause all patterns created from them to have those attributes applied.

To access members of the variable the attribute is applied to, use the `this` keyword. Some attributes expect an optional pattern as argument. If this is not necessary, you can use the `null` keyword instead.
{% endhint %}

#### `[[color("RRGGBB")]]`

Changes the color the variable is being highlighted in the hex editor.

#### `[[name("new_name")]]`

Changes the display name of the variable in the pattern data view without affecting the rest of the program.

#### `[[comment("text")]]`

Adds a comment to the current variable that is displayed when hovering over it in the pattern data view.

#### `[[format("formatter_function_name")]]` / `[[format_read("formatter_function_name")]]`

Overrides the default display value formatter with a custom function. The function requires a single argument representing the value to be formatted (e.g `u32` if this attribute was applied to a variable of type `u32`) and return a string which will be displayed in place of the default value.

It’s also possible to return a pattern or value from this function which will then be default formatted using the default pattern language rules.

#### `[[format_write("formatter_function_name")]]`

Allows to specify a custom write formatter function for a type. The function takes in a string of the input provided by the user and returns any pattern that will be turned into bytes and gets written to the address of that pattern.

#### `[[format_entries("formatter_function_name")]]` / `[[format_read_entries("formatter_function_name")]]`

Can be applied to arrays and works the same as the `[[format_read]]` attribute but overrides the default display value formatter of all array entries instead of just the array pattern itself.

#### `[[format_write_entries("formatter_function_name")]]`

Can be applied to arrays and works the same as the `[[format_write]]` attribute but overrides the default value write formatter of all array entries instead of just the array pattern itself.

#### `[[hidden]]`

Prevents a variable from being shown in the pattern data view but still be usable from the rest of the program.

#### `[[inline]]`

Can only be applied to Arrays and Struct-like types. Visually inlines all members of this variable into the parent scope. Useful to flatten the displayed tree structure and avoid unnecessary indentation while keeping the pattern structured.

#### `[[transform("transformer_function_name")]]`

Specifies a function that will be executed to preprocess the value read from that variable before it’s accessed through the dot syntax (`some_struct.some_value`). The function requires a single argument representing the original value that was read (e.g `u32` if this attribute was applied to a variable of type `u32`) and return a value that will be returned instead.

#### `[[transform_entries("transformer_function_name")]]`

Can be applied to arrays and works the same as the `[[transform]]` attribute but overrides the transform function of all array entries instead of just the array pattern itself.

#### `[[pointer_base("pointer_base_function_name")]]`

Specifies a function that will be executed to preprocess the address of the pointer this attribute was applied to. The function requires a single argument representing the original pointer address that was read (e.g `u32` if this attribute was applied to a pointer with size type `u32`) and return the offset the pointer should point to instead.

There’s a number of predefined pointer helper functions available in the standard library (`std::ptr`) to rebase pointers off of different places.

#### `[[no_unique_address]]`

A variable marked by this attribute will be placed in memory but not increment the current cursor position.

#### `[[single_color]]`

Forces all members of the struct, union or array to be highlighted using the same color instead of individual ones

### Type Attributes

#### `[[static]]`

The Pattern Language by default optimizes arrays of built-in types so they don’t use up as much memory and are evaluated quicker.

This same optimization can be applied to custom data types when they are marked with this attribute to tell the runtime the size and layout of this type will always be the same.

**However** if the layout of the type this is applied to is not static or you're using functions or function statements (such as local variables) in them, highlighing and decoding of the data will be wrong! The behaviour is undefined and can change with any release. Do not depend on it!

#### `[[bitfield_order(ordering, size)]]`

This attribute changes the ordering and alignment of the fields within the bitfield it is applied to.

`ordering` can either be `std::core::BitfieldOrder::LeastToMostSignificant` or `std::core::BitfieldOrder::MostToLeastSignificant`. By default, if no custom bitfield ordering is set, if the bitfield is little endian, it orders the fields from least to most significant bit. If it's big endian, it orders the fields from most to least significant bit.

Using most to least significant also requires you to specify the full size of the bitfield so the runtime knows where to start placing the fields.

#### `[[sealed]]`

This attribute can be applied to structs, unions and bitfields. It causes tools that display Patterns in some way to not display the implementation details (such as children of this type) anymore but instead treat it like a built-in type. This is mainly useful for making custom types that should decode and display the bytes in a custom format using the `[[format]]` attribute.

#### `[[highlight_hidden]]`

Works the same as the `[[hidden]]` attribute but only hides the highlighting of the variable and not the variable in the pattern data view.

#### `[[export]]`

This attribute allows exporting of pattern local variables. By default pattern local variables will not end up in the output and are only used to store temporary values within patterns. Adding this attribute to one will make it end up in the output the same as a regular variable.

Very useful if a value needs to be pre-processed before being output.
