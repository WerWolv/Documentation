### Creating a bookmark

Bookmarks are an easy way to quickly remember regions of data and add a name and comment to it. To create a bookmark, simply select a region of bytes and either click on the Bookmark icon in the Toolbar or use the `Edit -> Create bookmark` option. A new bookmark will appear in the list which can be opened by clicking on it and then be modified.

### Interacting with bookmarks

Once a bookmark has been created, it can be selected in the bookmark list. Clicking on its entry reveals all its properties that can be modified. To delete a bookmark, first make sure it's unlocked and then click on the `X` button in the header of the relevant bookmark. Bookmarks can also be moved around when they're closed by simply dragging them around the list.

In the `Name` row, a new name can be entered that will show up in the header as well.

Also the color can be modified by clicking on the color button to the left of it. A popup with a color picker and various template colors will open and can be used to change the color.

Bookmarks can also be locked by pressing on the Lock icon in the `Name` column. This will prevent any modifications of this bookmark and disallow deleting it. To unlock the bookmark, simply click on the button again.

Besides the name, a comment can be entered to document additional information that are relevant for this data.

All information entered here will also show up when hovering over the bookmark in the Hex Editor View and holding down the `SHIFT` key.
